# _Puzzle Rain_

_Puzzle Rain_ is a musical journey in which you help awaken and guide mythical creatures back together into happy musical harmony with one another. Only their combined musical chorus can summon life-giving rain to revive the parched and desolate landscape. Though, there isnâ€™t much time. Dangerous predators roam!
